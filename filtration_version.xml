	<ReleaseNotes>♦ 0.13 Hotfix - Fixed #28 - Add appearance block item links firing wrong command
♦ The Item Base Types and Item Classes static data files will now auto-update without requiring a new release of Filtration.
♦ Fixed #26 - Improved "do you want to save changes" detection - now just editing a block item will mark a file as having changes made rather than that flag only being set when you add or remove an entire block.
♦ Implemented #22 - Improved UI for "list" block items such as Base Types and Classes, it is now possible to remove items from lists by clicking the X that appears on hover rather than only being able to use the Delete key on the keyboard.
♦ Fixed #20 - "Switch to Regular block items" link does not work if there are no Appearance conditions active
♦ Removed != operator (it doesn't exist in game) as per #17
♦ Fixed the black border that sometimes appears when running Filtration on Windows 10
♦ Retargeted to .NET Framework 4.6.1 - Windows 10 has built in support, previous versions of Windows will require .NET Framework 4.6.1 manually installing, available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=49981</ReleaseNotes>
