	<ReleaseNotes>♦ Happy Awakening Release Day!
♦ Added Jewel to Item Class auto-complete (Individual Jewel Base Types will be added in a future release - you can still manually enter these however)
♦ Fixed a crash when opening a script after Filtration is opened via File association. Please note that Filtration does not currently support opening scripts via file association (it will open but not open the script).
♦ Fixed a bug that caused Disabled Blocks with a Block Group to not be loaded.
♦ Fixed a memory leak causing scripts to not be released from memory after they're closed.</ReleaseNotes>
